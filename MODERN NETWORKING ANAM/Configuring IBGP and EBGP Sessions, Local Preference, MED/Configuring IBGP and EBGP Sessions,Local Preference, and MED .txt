                                  PRATICAL 3:
Configuring IBGP and EBGP Sessions, Local Preference, 
and MED

Step 0: Suggested starting configurations.
a. Apply the following configuration to each router along with the appropriate 
hostname. The exec-timeout 0 0 command should only be used in a lab 
environment.
no ip domain-lookup
line con 0
logging synchronous
exec-timeout 0 0

Router R1 (hostname ISP):
interface Loopback0
ip address 192.168.100.1 255.255.255.0
exit
interface Serial1/0
ip address 192.168.1.5 255.255.255.252
clock rate 128000
no shutdown
exit
interface Serial1/1
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.252
no shutdown
end


Router R2 (hostname SanJose1):

interface Loopback0
ip address 172.16.64.1 255.255.255.0
exit
interface Serial1/0
ip address 192.168.1.6 255.255.255.252
no shutdown
exit
interface Serial1/1
ip address 172.16.1.1 255.255.255.0
clock rate 128000
no shutdown
end


Router R3 (hostname SanJose2):
interface Loopback0
ip address 172.16.32.1 255.255.255.0
exit
interface Serial1/0
ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.252
clock rate 128000
no shutdown
exit
interface Serial1/1
ip address 172.16.1.2 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
end

b. Use ping to test the connectivity between the directly connected routers. Both 
SanJose routers should be able to ping each other and their local ISP serial link IP 
address. The ISP router cannot reach the segment between SanJose1 and 
SanJose2.
Step 2: Configure EIGRP.
Configure EIGRP between the SanJose1 and SanJose2 routers. 
SanJose1#conf t
router eigrp 1
network 172.16.0.0
SanJose2#conf t
router eigrp 1
network 172.16.0.0

Step 3: Configure IBGP and verify BGP neighbors.
a. Configure IBGP between the SanJose1 and SanJose2 routers. On the SanJose1 
router, enter the following configuration.
SonJose1(config-router):exit
SonJose1(config):
router bgp 64512
neighbor 172.16.32.1 remote-as 64512
neighbor 172.16.32.1 update-source lo0
b. Complete the IBGP configuration on SanJose2 using the following commands.
SonJose2(config-router):exit
SonJose2(config):
router bgp 64512
neighbor 172.16.64.1 remote-as 64512
neighbor 172.16.64.1 update-source lo0
c. Verify that SanJose1 and SanJose2 become BGP neighbors by issuing the show 
ip bgp neighbors command on SanJose1. View the following partial output. If the 
BGP state is not established, troubleshoot the connection.
SonJose2(config-router):exit
SonJose2(config):end
SanJose2#
show ip bgp neighbors

Step 4: Configure EBGP and verify BGP neighbors.
a. Configure ISP to run EBGP with SanJose1 and SanJose2. Enter the following 
commands on ISP.
ISP#conf t
router bgp 200
neighbor 192.168.1.6 remote-as 64512
neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 64512
network 192.168.100.0

b. Configure a discard static route for the 172.16.0.0/16 network. Any packets that 
do not have a more specific match(longer match) for a 172.16.0.0 subnet will be 
dropped instead of sent to the ISP. Later in this lab we will configure a default 
route to the ISP.
SanJose1(config-router)#exit
SanJose1(config)#
ip route 172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0 null0

c. Configure SanJose1 as an EBGP peer to ISP.
SanJose1(config)# 
router bgp 64512
neighbor 192.168.1.5 remote-as 200
network 172.16.0.0

d. Use the show ip bgp neighbors command to verify that SanJose1 and ISP have 
reached the established state. Troubleshoot if necessary.
SanJose1(config-router)#end
SanJose1# 
show ip bgp neighbors


e. Configure a discard static route for 172.16.0.0/16 on SanJose2 and as an EBGP 
peer to ISP.
SanJose2# conf t
ip route 172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0 null0
router bgp 64512
neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 200
network 172.16.0.0

Step 5: View BGP summary output.
In Step 4, the show ip bgp neighbors command was used to verify that SanJose1 and 
ISP had reached the established state. 
A useful alternative command is show ip bgp summary. The output should be similar to 
the following.
SanJose2(config-router)#end
SanJose2#
show ip bgp summary

Step 6: Verify which path the traffic takes.
a. Clear the IP BGP conversation with the clear ip bgp * command on ISP. Wait 
for the conversations to reestablish
with each SanJose router.
ISP(config-router)#end
ISP# 
clear ip bgp *
ping 172.16.64.1
ping 172.16.1.1
ping 172.16.32.1
ping 172.16.1.2
show ip bgp
ping 172.16.1.1 source 192.168.100.1
ping 172.16.32.1 source 192.168.100.1
ping 172.16.1.2 source 192.168.100.1
ping 172.16.64.1 source 192.168.100.1
ISP#
ping

!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 20/20/24 ms


Step 7: Configure the BGP next-hop-self feature.
a. Issue the following commands on the ISP router.
ISP#conf t
ISP(config)#
router bgp 200
network 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.252
network 192.168.1.4 mask 255.255.255.252
ISP(config-router)#end
ISP#
show ip bgp

c. Verify on SanJose1 and SanJose2 that the opposite WAN link is included in the routing 
table. 
SanJose2# 
show ip route

d. To better understand the next-hop-self command we will remove ISP advertising its 
two WAN links and shutdown the WAN link between ISP and SanJose2. The only possible 
path from SanJose2 to ISP’s 192.168.100.0/24 is through SanJose1.
ISP#conf t
ISP(config)# 
router bgp 200
no network 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.252
no network 192.168.1.4 mask 255.255.255.252
exit
interface serial 1/1
shutdown

e. Display SanJose2’s BGP table using the show ip bgp command and the IPv4 
routing table with show ip route.
SanJose2# 
show ip bgp

f. Issue the next-hop-self command on SanJose1 and SanJose2 to advertise 
themselves as the next hop to their IBGP peer.
SanJose1#conf t
SanJose1(config)# 
router bgp 64512
neighbor 172.16.32.1 next-hop-self
SanJose2#conf t
SanJose2(config)# 
router bgp 64512
neighbor 172.16.64.1 next-hop-self

g. Reset BGP operation on either router with the clear ip bgp * command.
SanJose1# 
clear ip bgp *
SanJose2# 
clear ip bgp *

h. After the routers have returned to established BGP speakers, issue the show ip 
bgp command on SanJose2 and notice that the next hop is now SanJose1 instead 
of ISP.
SanJose2# 
show ip bgp
SanJose2# 
show ip route

j. Before configuring the next BGP attribute, restore the WAN link between ISP 
and SanJose3. This will change the BGP table and routing table on both routers. 
For example, SanJose2’sexit

 routing table shows 192.168.100.0/24 will now have a 
better path through ISP.
ISP(config)# 
interface serial 1/1
no shutdown
SanJose2# 
show ip route

B 192.168.100.0/24 [20/0] via 192.168.1.1, 00:01:35
Step 8: Set BGP local preference.
a. Because the local preference value is shared between IBGP neighbors, configure 
a simple route map that references the local preference value on SanJose1 and 
SanJose2. This policy adjusts outbound traffic to prefer the link off the SanJose1 
router instead of the metered T1 off SanJose2.
SanJose1(config)# 
route-map PRIMARY_T1_IN permit 10
set local-preference 150
exit
router bgp 64512
neighbor 192.168.1.5 route-map PRIMARY_T1_IN in
SanJose2(config)#
route-map SECONDARY_T1_IN permit 10
set local-preference 125
SanJose1(config-route-map)# 
exit
SanJose2(config)# 
router bgp 64512
neighbor 192.168.1.1 route-map SECONDARY_T1_IN in

b. Use the clear ip bgp * soft command after configuring this new policy. When the 
conversations have been reestablished, issue the show ip bgp command on 
SanJose1 and SanJose2.
SanJose1# 
clear ip bgp * soft
SanJose2# 
clear ip bgp * soft
SanJose1# 
show ip bgp
SanJose2# 
show ip bgp

Step 9: Set BGP MED.
a. Examine what the return path ISP takes to reach AS 64512. Notice that the 
return path is different from the original path. 
ISP# 
show ip bgp
show ip route

b. Use an extended ping command to verify this situation. Specify the record option 
and compare your output to thenfollowing. Notice the return path using the exit 
interface 192.168.1.1 to SanJose2.
SanJose2# 
ping

End of list
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 20/20/24 ms
SanJose2#


c. Create a new policy to force the ISP router to return all traffic via SanJose1. Create a 
second route map utilizing the MED (metric) that is shared between EBGP neighbors.
SanJose1(config)#
route-map PRIMARY_T1_MED_OUT permit 10
set Metric 50
exit
router bgp 64512
neighbor 192.168.1.5 route-map PRIMARY_T1_MED_OUT out
SanJose2(config)#
route-map SECONDARY_T1_MED_OUT permit 10
set Metric 75
exit
router bgp 64512
neighbor 192.168.1.1 route-map SECONDARY_T1_MED_OUT out

d. Use the clear ip bgp * soft command after issuing this new policy. Issuing the show ip 
bgp command as follows onSanJose1 or SanJose2 does not indicate anything about this 
newly defined policy.
SanJose1# 
clear ip bgp * soft
SanJose2# 
clear ip bgp * soft
SanJose1# 
show ip bgp
SanJose2# 
show ip bgp


e. Reissue an extended ping command with the record command. Notice the change in 
return path using the exit interface 192.168.1.5 to SanJose1.

ISP# 
show ip bgp

Step 10: Establish a default route.
a. Configure ISP to inject a default route to both SanJose1 and SanJose2 using BGP using 
the default-originate command. This command does not require the presence of 0.0.0.0 in 
the ISP router. Configure the 10.0.0.0/8 network which will not be advertised using BGP. 
This network will be used to test the default route on SanJose1 and SanJose2.
ISP(config)# 
router bgp 200
neighbor 192.168.1.6 default-originate
neighbor 192.168.1.2 default-originate
exit
interface loopback 10
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0


c. The preferred default route is by way of SanJose1 because of the higher local 
preference attribute configured on SanJose1 earlier.
SanJose2# 
show ip bgp
d. Using the traceroute command verify that packets to 10.0.0.1 is using the default route 
through SanJose1.
SanJose2# 
traceroute 10.0.0.1

e. Next, test how BGP adapts to using a different default route when the path between 
SanJose1 and ISP goes down.
ISP(config)# 
interface serial 1/0
shutdown

f. Verify that both routers have received the default route by examining the routing tables 
on SanJose1 and SanJose2. Notice that both routers prefer the route between SanJose1 
and ISP.
SanJose1# 
show ip route
SanJose2# 
show ip route

g. Verify the new path using the traceroute command to 10.0.0.1 from SanJose1. Notice 
the default route is now through SanJose2.
SanJose1# 
trace 10.0.0.1
