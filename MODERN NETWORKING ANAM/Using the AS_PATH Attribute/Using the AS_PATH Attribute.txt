	                    PRATICAL 2: 
Using the AS_PATH Attribute


Step 0: Suggested starting configurations.
a. Apply the following configuration to each router along with the 
appropriate hostname. The exec-timeout 0 0 command should only be used in a lab 
environment.

Router(config)# 
no ip domain-lookup
line con 0
logging synchronous
exec-timeout 0 0


Step 1: Configure interface addresses.
b. Using the addressing scheme in the diagram, create the loopback interfaces and apply 
IPv4 addresses to these and the serial interfaces on SanJose (R1), ISP (R2), and CustRtr 
(R3). The ISP loopbacks simulate real networks. Set a clock rate on the DCE serial 
interfaces.
hostname SanJose
SanJose(config)# 
interface Loopback0
ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
exit
interface Serial1/0
ip address 192.168.1.5 255.255.255.252
clock rate 128000
no shutdown
end

hostname ISP
ISP(config)# 
interface Loopback0
ip address 10.2.2.1 255.255.255.0
interface Serial1/0
ip address 192.168.1.6 255.255.255.252
no shutdown
exit
interface Serial1/1
ip address 172.24.1.17 255.255.255.252
clock rate 128000
no shutdown
end

hostname CustRtr
CustRtr(config)# 
interface Loopback0
ip address 10.3.3.1 255.255.255.0
exit
interface Serial1/1
ip address 172.24.1.18 255.255.255.252
no shutdown
end

Step 2: Configure BGP.

a. Configure BGP for normal operation. Enter the appropriate BGP commands on each 
router so that they identify their BGP neighbors and advertise their loopback networks.

SanJose(config)# 
router bgp 100
neighbor 192.168.1.6 remote-as 300
network 10.1.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0


ISP(config)# 
router bgp 300
neighbor 192.168.1.5 remote-as 100
neighbor 172.24.1.18 remote-as 65000
network 10.2.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0


CustRtr(config)# 
router bgp 65000
neighbor 172.24.1.17 remote-as 300
network 10.3.3.0 mask 255.255.255.0

b. Verify that these routers have established the appropriate neighbor relationships by 
issuing the show ip bgp neighbors command on each router.

ISP# 
show ip bgp neighbors

Step 3: Remove the private AS.
a. Display the SanJose routing table using the show ip route command. SanJose should 
have a route to both 10.2.2.0 and 10.3.3.0. Troubleshoot if necessary.

SanJose#
show ip rout

b. Ping the 10.3.3.1 address from SanJose.
c. Ping again, this time as an extended ping, sourcing from the Loopback0 interface 
address.

SanJose# ping
Protocol [ip]: 
Target IP address: 10.3.3.1
Repeat count [5]: 
Datagram size [100]: 
Timeout in seconds [2]: 
Extended commands [n]: y
Source address or interface: 10.1.1.1
Type of service [0]: 
Set DF bit in IP header? [no]: 
Validate reply data? [no]: 
Data pattern [0xABCD]: 
Loose, Strict, Record, Timestamp, Verbose[none]: 
Sweep range of sizes [n]: 
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.3.3.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
Packet sent with a source address of 10.1.1.1
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max =28/28/28 ms
SanJose#

SanJose# 
ping 10.3.3.1 source 10.1.1.1

SanJose# 
show ip bgp

e. Configure ISP to strip the private AS numbers from BGP routes exchanged with 
SanJose using the following commands.
ISP(config)# 
router bgp 300
neighbor 192.168.1.5 remove-private-as

ISP# 
clear ip bgp * 


SanJose# 
show ip route

SanJose# 
ping 10.3.3.1 source lo0

SanJose# 
show ip bgp

Step 4: Use the AS_PATH attribute to filter routes.
a. Configure a special kind of access list to match BGP routes with an AS_PATH 
attribute that both begins and ends with the number 100. Enter the following commands 
on ISP.

ISP(config)# 
ip as-path access-list 1 deny ^100$
ip as-path access-list 1 permit .*


b. Apply the configured access list using the neighbor command with the filterlist option.
ISP(config)# 
router bgp 300
neighbor 172.24.1.18 filter-list 1 out

c. Use the clear ip bgp * command to reset the routing information. Wait several 
seconds and then check the routing table for ISP. The route to 10.1.1.0 should be in the 
routing table.
ISP# 
clear ip bgp *
show ip route

d. Check the routing table for CustRtr. It should not have a route to 10.1.1.0 in its 
routing table.
CustRtr# 
show ip route

e. Return to ISP and verify that the filter is working as intended. Issue the show ip bgp
regexp ^100$ command.

ISP# 
show ip bgp regexp ^100$

f. Run the following Tcl script on all routers to verify whether there is connectivity. 
All pings from ISP should be successful. SanJose should not be able to ping the 
CustRtr loopback 10.3.3.1 or the WAN link 172.24.1.16/30. CustRtr should not be 
able to ping the SanJose loopback 10.1.1.1 or the WAN link 192.168.1.4/30.

ISP# 
tclsh

foreach address { 10.1.1.1 10.2.2.1 10.3.3.1 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.6 172.24.1.17
172.24.1.18 } { ping $address }
